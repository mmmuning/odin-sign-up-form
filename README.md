## SIGN-UP FORM

This project is part of [The Odin Project’s Intermediate HTML and CSS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).
It’s a simple sign-up form designed to practice building and styling forms while applying modern HTML and CSS techniques.

### This project includes:

- A sign-up page with labeled input fields for user information
- Client-side validation using HTML attributes (`required`, `type`, and `pattern`)
- Custom styling for default, focus, valid, and invalid input states
- Use of CSS variables, rem units, and pseudo-classes for scalable design
- A two-column layout with a sidebar image, logo, and photo credits

### Through this project, I practiced and demonstrated:

- Creating accessible and semantic HTML form structures
- Using CSS Flexbox for layout alignment and responsiveness
- Applying consistent spacing and sizing with rem units
- Handling input validation purely with HTML and CSS pseudo-classes (`:valid`, `:invalid`, `:focus`)
- Managing reusable colors and styles with CSS custom properties (`--variables`)
